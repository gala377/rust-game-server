## RUST WarGame!
This repository contains server for a strategy multiplayer game written in RUST.
Documenation of game rules and basic communiacation protocols for clients can be found here:

- [polish documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lOMBsphAH98Ix2NzKGOegy7sBxEMo3sUMsRfiVjzJsw/edit?usp=sharing)
- ~~english documentation~~

Keep in mind that it's still early work so even documentations aren't completed. 

## Installation
Clone the repository and build with cargo. Rust version used for this project is 1.27. 
For now server just listens for requests and sends back message "Hi", so there really is no point in running it now.

## What's more?
Alongside with this a python GUI client for the game is being created so there will be a way to play a game when it's done.
