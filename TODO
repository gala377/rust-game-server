// Game get_unit_by id

// server communication protocol
// Game to the end

// Game security
// Game generates random player identifier
// Server maps identifiers to player name
// Player knows about it's own identifier and names of the others
// If he wants to communicate he needs to send his <name:identifier> base64 encoded
// This way he knows which unit's are whose player (by their owners name) but
// cannot send request in their name
