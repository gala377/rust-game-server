// server communication protocol
// Game to the end

// Game security
// Game generates random player identifier
// Server maps identifiers to player name
// Player knows about it's own identifier and names of the others
// If he wants to communicate he needs to send his <name:identifier> base64 encoded
// This way he knows which unit's are whose player (by their owners name) but
// cannot send request in their name


For now:
     ? Communication with the Server and Connection Handlers by channel.
        - note: Do we really need to be able to communicate to the
                running server from the console? 
                We can, but do we need to? 

     ? ConnectionHandler - Context struct reference
     ? ConnectionHandler - refactoring

     Paths - export paths refactor to unified paths from rust 1.31
